    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup sushi rice</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>4 sheets nori (seaweed)</li>
      <li>1 cucumber, julienned</li>
      <li>Soy sauce, for serving</li>
      <li>Wasabi, for serving</li>
      <li>Pickled ginger, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Rinse the sushi rice under cold water until the water runs clear.
        Combine the rice and 1.2 cups of water in a rice cooker and cook
        according to the manufacturer's instructions.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a small saucepan, combine the rice vinegar, sugar, and salt. Cook
        over medium heat until the sugar dissolves. Cool to room temperature.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer the cooked rice to a large bowl and gently fold in the vinegar
        mixture. Allow the rice to cool to room temperature, covered with a damp
        cloth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place a sheet of nori on a bamboo sushi mat. With wet fingers, evenly
        spread a thin layer of rice over the nori, leaving about 1/2 inch of
        nori uncovered at the top.
      </li>
      <li>
        Arrange a few sticks of cucumber on the rice towards the bottom edge of
        the nori sheet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beginning at the bottom edge, tightly roll the nori and rice over the
        fillings using the bamboo mat to help shape the roll. Seal the edge of
        the nori with a little water.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using a sharp knife, cut the roll into six equal pieces. Serve with soy
        sauce, wasabi, and pickled ginger.
      </li>
    </ol>
