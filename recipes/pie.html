    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the Pie Crust:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
      <li>1 cup unsalted butter, chilled and diced</li>
      <li>1/4 to 1/2 cup ice water</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For the Filling:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>6 to 8 apples, peeled, cored, and sliced</li>
      <li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1 egg yolk and 1 teaspoon water (for egg wash)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        To make the crust: In a large bowl, combine flour, salt, and sugar. Add
        butter and blend until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually
        add ice water, stirring until the dough comes together. Divide dough in
        half, and flatten into disks. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for at
        least 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C).</li>
      <li>
        To make the filling: In a large bowl, mix together the sliced apples,
        sugar, flour, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        On a lightly floured surface, roll out one disk of dough into a 12-inch
        circle. Transfer to a 9-inch pie plate. Pour the apple mixture into the
        crust and dot with butter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roll out the second disk of dough and place over the filling. Trim the
        excess dough, and crimp the edges to seal. Cut slits in the top crust to
        allow steam to escape. Brush with egg wash for a golden finish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 45 to 55 minutes, or until the crust is
        golden brown and the filling is bubbly. Cool on a wire rack before
        serving.
