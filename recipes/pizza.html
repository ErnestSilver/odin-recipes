    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><h3>Prepare the dough:</h3></li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In a small bowl, combine the warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit
          for about 5 minutes until foamy.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a large mixing bowl, combine 3 ½ cups of flour and salt. Make a
          well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture and olive oil.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stir until a dough forms, adding more flour if needed to make a soft,
          slightly sticky dough.
        </li>
        <li>
          Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for about 5-7 minutes
          until smooth and elastic.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a clean kitchen towel or
          plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-1.5 hours
          until doubled in size.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li><h3>Make the sauce:</h3></li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In a saucepan, combine the crushed tomatoes, minced garlic, oregano,
          basil, salt, and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
          Simmer the sauce over low heat for about 15-20 minutes until
          thickened. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li><h3>Assemble the pizza:</h3></li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C) and grease a pizza pan or baking
          sheet.
        </li>
        <li>
          Punch down the risen dough and divide it in half for two pizzas, or
          leave it whole for one large pizza.
        </li>
        <li>
          Roll out the dough on a floured surface to your desired thickness and
          shape.
        </li>
        <li>Transfer the dough to the prepared pan and stretch it to fit.</li>
      </ul>
      <li><h3>Top the pizza:</h3></li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Spread a layer of tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a border around
          the edges.
        </li>
        <li>Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce.</li>
        <li>Add your desired toppings evenly over the cheese.</li>
      </ul>
      <li><h3>Bake the pizza:</h3></li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Place the pizza in the preheated oven and bake for 12-15 minutes, or
          until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes
          before slicing and serving.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ol>
